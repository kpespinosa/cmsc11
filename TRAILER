WHAT IS A STRUCTURE?
IT IS A COMPOSITE DATA TYPE.

WHAT IS THAT?
IN CONTRAST TO PRIMITIVE TYPES LIKE CHAR, INT, DOUBLE, BOOL, THIS IS COMPOSITE, MEANING IT HAS WHAT?

IT HAS MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY.
FOR EXAMPLE, A STUDENT CAN BE DEFINED AS:

STUDENT:
	AGE
	NAME
	SEX
	ADDRESS

EACH OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE STUDENT IS A PRIMITIVE TYPE. THE STUDENT IS A COMPOSITE DATA TYPE OR WE CALL THEM STRUCTURES.

OK?  
HOW CAN I USE THE STRUCTURE STUDENT?

WELL, I CAN DECLARE A VARIABLE AS STUDENT.

EXAMPLE:

STUDENT A = {20, "KURT", MALE, "UP CEBU"};
STUDENT B = {100, "juvah", MALE, "SITIO BUNGOT"}


SO HERE, WE ARE DECLARING VARIABLES A AND B OF TYPE STUDENT RATHER THAN THE USUAL INT, CHAR, ETC.

GETS? OK. THAT'S IT!
