a string is an array of characters.

but the string must be declared with size +1 to account for the null character.

ex:
char name[] = {"Kurt"};//valid without size because it is initialised

char name[];//error

char name[30];
name = "Kurt";

char* name is equal to char name[size];//see you in CMSC21



====================


Class cs11 = {};
Student s = cs11.students[0]//returns a student
s.name;

cs11.students[0].name

Student a = {}
a.name


===================

Exercise:

1. Create a structure Class with 
the following properties:

1. array of students length 30
2. size of class 

int ar[30];
Student ar[30];

2. Print all the students - just their names.
Create a function listStudents with 
parameter class.
